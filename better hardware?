some findings that aids programming!

It seems like after years of using an x86 windows systems , i found that macbooks are better equipped for 
programming and web-development due to faster compilation and execution time.
ARM (system on a chip) combined with Rosetta (a translation layer between ARM and x86) works faster than a native windows machine and
even faster for linux based machines. If you are reading this , i suggest you to purchase a macbook with atleast an M1 chip (late 2020)
for programming as i find the ecosystem an all rounder with an awesome community support.

?) Installing windows on an ARM Based Macbook using virtual machine :

1) https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/trial 
              - Prallels is Microsoft Authorized Virtual Machine for mac(14 days free trial and paid afterwards!)
              
2)https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html 
              - Free VM but less seamlesss and Integrated than paralleles
