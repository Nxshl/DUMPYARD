some findings that aids programming!

ARM based (system on a chip) combined with Rosetta (a translation layer between ARM and x86)
works faster than a native windows machine and even faster for linux based machines (as macs are a unix based system).
If you are reading this , i suggest you to purchase a macbook with atleast an M1 chip (late 2020)
for programming as i find the ecosystem an all rounder with an awesome community support. As Macbooks runs based on UNIX 
and most programming languages natively runs by without requiring an extension or long compilation times !

?) Installing windows on an ARM Based Macbook using virtual machine :

              - Prallels is Microsoft Authorized Virtual Machine for mac
              
2)https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html 
              - Free VM but less seamlesss and Integrated than paralleles
